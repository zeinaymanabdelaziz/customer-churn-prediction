# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications sector.  
<br>Developed to help businesses identify at-risk customers and support proactive retention strategies.

# Project Overview

This project analyzes telecom customer behavior to predict the likelihood of churn (customer leaving the service).  
<br>The goal is to enable telecom providers to take preventive action through targeted retention efforts.

# Techniques Applied

- âœ… Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- âœ… Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- âœ… Model comparison: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM
- âœ… ROC-AUC analysis for performance evaluation

# Models Evaluated

| Model            | Evaluation Metric | Notes                                   |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Decision Tree    | ROC-AUC           | Interpretable but may overfit           |
| Naive Bayes      | ROC-AUC           | Fast and simple, assumes feature independence |
| Random Forest    | ROC-AUC           | Robust with better generalization       |
| SVM              | ROC-AUC           | Good with high-dimensional spaces       |

âœ… **Best Model**: Based on ROC-AUC performance and generalization, **Random Forest** showed consistent results across validation.
